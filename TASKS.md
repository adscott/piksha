# Docker Packaging Tasks

  * Add Dockerfile and Makefile.
    * Create application docker image.
    * Remove deb tasks
    * Run tests?
    * Deployment process?
      * Can build image locally/CI and publish.
      * Can build image on deployment box. This is probably easier.
  * Migrate backend to python.
  * Write events to append only file, remove mongodb dependency.
